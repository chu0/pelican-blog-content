Lyrics by [Jeff Williams](http://roosterteeth.com/williams)

    They see you as small and helpless;
    They see you as just a child.
    Surprise when they find out that a warrior will soon run wild.
    Prepare for your greatest moments;
    Prepare for your finest hour.
    The dream that you've always dreamed is suddenly about to flower.

    We are lightning,
    Straying from the thunder,
    Miracles of ancient wonder.

    This will be the day we've waited for.
    This will be the day we open up the door.
    I don't wanna hear your absolution,
    Hope you're ready for a revolution.
    Welcome to a world of new solutions.
    Welcome to a world of bloody evolution.
    In time, your heart will open minds,
    A story will be told,
    And victory is in a simple soul.

    Your world needs a great defender.
    Your world's in the way of harm.
    You want a romantic life; a fairytale that's full of charm.

    Beware that the light is fading;
    Beware if the dark returns.
    This world's unforgiving, even brilliant lights will cease to burn.

    Legends scatter.
    Day and night will sever.
    Hope and peace are lost forever.

    This will be the day we've waited for.
    We are lightning.
    Welcome to a world of new solutions.

    This will be the day we've waited for.
    This will be the day we open up the door.
    I don't wanna hear your absolution;
    Hope you're ready for a revolution.
    Welcome to a world of new solutions.
    Welcome to a world of bloody evolution.
    In time, your heart will open minds,
    A story will be told,
    That victory is in a simple soul.
